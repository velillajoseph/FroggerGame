# Welcome to Frogger!

# The classic game were you try to cross the road to other side and evade the obstacles as you go. Win by taking the frogs to their home at the other side of the river. But be careful! You only have 4 lives and its GAME OVER.

# How to play? It's simple!

# You move the frog up, down, left, or right, by using the 4 directional keys in your keyboard.
